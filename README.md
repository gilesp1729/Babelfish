# Babelfish

## Android app branch only

The Babelfish Arduino project for Bafang CAN bus is no longer supported. It is preserved in the CANBus branch. This master branch is for the Android phone app only.

### BabelVESC

This version interfaces with Farnsworth to control a VESC by pedelec, using the Bafang M510 torque/cadence sensor (the analog version) and a speed sensor on the wheel. The phone app gives a display of motor status, speed and the like, and allows PAS level to be changed.

BabelVESC runs on late-model Android phones. It is written using B4A.
