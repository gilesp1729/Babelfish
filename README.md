# Babelfish

## Android app branch only

The Babelfish Arduino project for Bafang CAN bus is no longer supported. It is preserved in the CANBus branch. This master branch is for the Android phone app only, which will be extended to use with Farnsworth (Babelfish for VESC) and possibly other applications.
